# Wits Overflow (Website & Mobile App)

This section contains the code for the client application(s) of the Wits Software Design project 2021.

## Getting started

> This section is also available [here](https://github.com/gltch/wits-overflow/wiki/Getting-Started#app).

### Getting the Flutter app up and running.

Follow the Flutter installation guide here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install.

> Note you will probably have to open the Flutter app directory as the root directory in your IDE because at this time Flutter doesn't support launching apps from sub-directories...

Run the following command to check that everything installed correctly:

````
flutter doctor
````

In the app directory, run the following command to install the Flutter dependencies:

````
flutter pub get
````

Run the following command to test the app:

````
flutter test
````

Once this is done you should be able to debug the flutter app by pressing F5 as usual.
